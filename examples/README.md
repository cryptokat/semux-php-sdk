# Semux PHP SDK Examples

The examples require a `devnet` node with the private key of `302e020100300506032b657004220420acbd5f2cb2b6053f704376d12df99f2aa163d267a755c7f1d9fe55d2a2dc5405` imported as coinbase to be normally executed.

Please see [Devnet Documentation](https://github.com/semuxproject/semux/blob/master/docs/Devnet.md) to learn about how to start a `devnet` node.
